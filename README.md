# Minecraft Sounds for VS Code (Source Repository)

This is the **source code** for the *Minecraft Sounds* extension for Visual Studio Code. It adds immersive, Minecraft-inspired sound effects to common VS Code actions like typing, saving, renaming files, and more.

**Note:** This repo does **not** include official Minecraft sound files due to copyright restrictions.

---

## Features

- Typing: Sand step sounds
- Backspace: Glass breaking
- Saving: Piston in/out combo
- Hover over errors: Villager "No!"
- Create/Delete/Rename Files: Chest, Lava, Anvil sounds
- Open Settings: Anvil land
- Terminal open/close: Enchanting sounds
- Undo/Redo: Pistons

---

## Developer Setup

### Requirements

- **Node.js** (v14+)
- **ffmpeg** (for `ffplay` fallback)
- **Visual Studio Code** v1.99.0+

### Steps

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Moltenshoe/minecraft_sounds_vscode.git
cd minecraft_sounds_vscode
npm install
npm run compile
```
### To package the extension as .vsix:
```bash
npx vsce package
```

## Add Your Own Sounds

The /sounds/ folder is excluded from the repository. You must manually add your .wav sound files.

Example:
```bash
/sounds/
├── click.wav
├── in.wav
├── out.wav
├── no1.wav
├── fizz.wav
```

## Folder Structure

This is how the folder structure should be:
```bash
minecraft_sounds_vscode/
├── src/                   # TypeScript source
├── sounds/                # Not included — add your own .wav files
├── out/                   # Build output (generated by compiler)
├── package.json           # VS Code extension manifest
├── tsconfig.json          # TypeScript configuration
├── CHANGELOG.md           # Full feature history
├── README.md              # This file
```
