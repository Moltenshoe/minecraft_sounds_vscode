## ❗ Sound Files Not Included

To avoid copyright issues, this extension ships **without** sound files.

To use:
1. Create a `sounds/` folder in the extension directory
2. Add your own `.wav` files named accordingly (e.g., `no1.wav`, `click.wav`, etc.)

---

## 💡 Tips

- Works best with `.wav` files.
- You can use free sound replacements or record your own.
- Sound playback uses `play-sound`, and falls back to `ffplay` if necessary.
